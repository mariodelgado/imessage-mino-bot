/**
 * Fluid Interface Hooks
 *
 * React hooks for building Apple-level fluid interactions:
 * - useFluidValue: Interruptible, redirectable animated values
 * - useDirectManipulation: One-to-one touch tracking with rubberbanding
 *
 * These hooks integrate seamlessly with react-native-reanimated
 * and react-native-gesture-handler.
